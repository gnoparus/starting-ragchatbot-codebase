Workflow
Make sure first that you've added and committed any previous changes to the codebase.
Create the folder .trees: mkdir .trees.
For each feature you want to implement, create a worktree:

git worktree add .trees/ui_feature
git worktree add .trees/testing_feature
git worktree add .trees/quality_feature

From each worktree, open an integrated terminal, launch Claude code in each terminal, and ask it to implement each feature.
For each worktree, add and commit the changes in each worktree.
Close claude terminals.
In the main terminal: ask Claude Code to git merge the worktrees and resolve any merge conflicts (use the git merge command to merge in all the worktrees of the .trees folder into main and fix any conflicts if there are any)
